# WelderToolbox

This project supersedes the Verified Elliptic Curve Cryptography (VEC) in Welder. It is a completion of the proof done there and includes the addition of tactics to automate the good repository that this project provided us with. 

You will find under ./vec the work we did there.
You will find under ./vec/documents interesting help to get started with Welder.
You will find under ./Tactics.scala the implemented tactics for the system.

To get an idea of our current interests you will find in ./articles papers that we have explore until now.
